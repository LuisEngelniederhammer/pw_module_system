#  Each scene record contains the following fields:
#  1) Scene id {string}: used for referencing scenes in other files. The prefix scn_ is automatically added before each scene-id.
#  2) Scene flags {int}. See header_scenes.py for a list of available flags
#  3) Mesh name {string}: This is used for indoor scenes only. Use the keyword "none" for outdoor scenes.
#  4) Body name {string}: This is used for indoor scenes only. Use the keyword "none" for outdoor scenes.
#  5) Min-pos {(float,float)}: minimum (x,y) coordinate. Player can't move beyond this limit.
#  6) Max-pos {(float,float)}: maximum (x,y) coordinate. Player can't move beyond this limit.
#  7) Water-level {float}. 
#  8) Terrain code {string}: You can obtain the terrain code by copying it from the terrain generator screen
#  9) List of other scenes accessible from this scene {list of strings}.
#     (deprecated. This will probably be removed in future versions of the module system)
#     (In the new system passages are used to travel between scenes and
#     the passage's variation-no is used to select the game menu item that the passage leads to.)
# 10) List of chest-troops used in this scene {list of strings}. You can access chests by placing them in edit mode.
#     The chest's variation-no is used with this list for selecting which troop's inventory it will access.
