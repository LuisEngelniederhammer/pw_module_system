General Information^^\
When you first join the game, you start in the commoners faction as a peasant; to train as another troop type and join a faction at the same time, go to one of the castles and use a training station. \
You can only join another faction as a commoner, or to become a commoner. The outlaws faction can be joined by training as one, but you will also get transferred to it after multiple team kills. \
Troop type, faction, gold, and outlaw rating are saved every few seconds, and if you get disconnected from the game, when you rejoin your previous stats will be given back, minus some gold. \
For a certain period after a player spawns they will be invulnerable to attack, and also unable to attack others; when this period is over the default weapons will be given.^^\
To buy items from stockpiles, sheath your weapons and tap the use button (rather than hold it down); to sell, hold the item in your hand and tap use. When bought, items are spawned right on top of the stockpile, so you might have to aim around until the 'Equip' overlay shows. \
Holding down the use key until the bar finishes is for crafting the item: you need to have the required engineering skill and resources equipped. If the item stockpile has no 'Stack count' line in the stats overlay, it is not craftable, and an unlimited amount of items can be bought there.^^\
Trees can be cut down for wood and mines hit for iron with the required labouring skill and tools; trees regrow after a while, and mines respawn after a longer period. \
These resources can be refined with engineering skill at stations in the castles - the carpenter's bench and the forge - and then used for crafting weapons or other items. \
The forge can be used to combine or split iron bar types into the larger or smaller type: to split, stand on the left side and use the forge, to combine, stand on the right. \
Certain destructable items like doors or bridges can be repaired with engineering skill, tools, and resources like wood (of which any wood item will do, though items can have different resource values).^^\
To sail a ship requires two players (or one player moving around a lot): using the up and down arrow keys near the main mast will change the forward or backward movement; using the left and right arrow keys near the rudder will steer the ship, as long as the steering player doesn't move away; up or down keys at the rudder will center it. Your level of sailing skill determines how fast you can sail. \
When the ramp is resting on the deck, using will move it away from the player, extending over the side, then using once more will move it back to the center; if the ship is not moving the ramp will angle down near ground level. The up arrow key can be used to climb up the side of the ship from close beside the middle section of the hull. \
Ships will be damaged when colliding with the ground, large objects in the water, or other ships, but they can be repaired with wood by engineers; otherwise, after enough damage they will sink. \
If you stay under water for too long you will drown - more quickly the faster you move.^^\
The money bag window (which is toggled with the native inventory key) can be used to drop money bag items, or access money chests. The value of the last money bag picked up is used when dropping one or pressing attack to get the money, rather than the particular bag you have wielded (due to game engine limitations). \
To deposit gold in a chest you must be near it, and to withdraw you also either need to be the lord of the associated faction, break the chest open with a weapon, or use a lock pick to open it (looting skill makes success more likely). To tell if a money chest is unlocked, press and release the use button: if you hear a click sound it is locked, but if no sound it is unlocked. \
When you die, a bag with a small percentage of your money and part of the value of your armor will be dropped, along with all your equipped items.^^\
Troops with the wound treatment skill can heal other badly wounded players by hitting them with the surgeon's scalpel, up to a certain percentage of full health; while resting on beds can be used by less wounded troops to heal fully - each type of bed can have a different minimum health required. \
Players hit with a poisoned dagger will die slowly over time, unless a doctor treats them with a healing herb leaf.^^\
Enemy castles can be captured for your faction by using the flag pole (probably on top of the castle keep) while holding a your faction's banner item. The banner and name of a faction can be changed by the lord; when the banner is changed, armor on players of that faction will be updated, but items will not.^^\
To shout with the local chat messages, hold down right shift while pressing enter. With faction chat messages, the lord can send messages that are displayed in big letters in the same way, with right shift."),

pw_scene_ambient_sound:^value 1 = sound id offset from snd_fire_loop^value 2 = probability the sound will be played (0 - 100) or 127 = looping^^\
^The values can be modified in the scene editor panel, scene prop section: the two fields, labelled 'Var No' and 'Var 2 No'. These can each store an integer in the range 0 - 127.^\
^The scene props with 'value 1 = faction + multiplier' share the same code for storing a combination of faction id / castle id and gold value multiplier in value 1:^\
0 is the commoner faction, which normally means the prop is not associated with any faction, 1 for outlaws, and 2 - 9 associate the scene prop with a castle (which defaults to the corresponding faction id from 2 - 5).^\
The other part is a multiple of 10, representing specific gold value multipliers:^\
0 = 100%, the default value^10 = 20%^20 = 40%^30 = 60%^40 = 80%^50 = 120%^60 = 140%^70 = 160%^80 = 180%^90 = 200%^100 = 350%^110 = 500%^120 = 1000%^\
These two separate values are combined: for example, 31 = outlaw faction and 60% value, 116 = castle 4 (starts as faction 0 - red faction) and 500% value.^\
^The scene props with 'value 2 = linking id with x' mean that they are designed to be linked to another scene prop, x representing the first scene prop's name:^\
On scene load, the props are linked by searching for the nearest prop in the scene of the specified type, with the same value 2, and that hasn't already been linked; so for example, with a teleport door pair on opposite sides of the scene, you could set the value 2 of both to 53 and not use that number for any of the other props of the same type, so they are linked correctly even when not close together, or if someone else adds more props of the same type in between."),
